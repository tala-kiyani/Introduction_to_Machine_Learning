# Linear Regression

This folder contains notebooks that implement the linear regression problem from scratch using numpy and apply it to real-world datasets using sklearn.

## Notebooks Included

- `01-Linear_Regression.ipynb`  
  Linear regression implemented from scratch with numpy on synthetic data.

- `Polynomial_Regression_Analytical_Solution.ipynb`  
  Analytical solution for polynomial regression.

- `Tehran_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`  
  Predicting house prices in Tehran using sklearn.

- `California_House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`  
  A practical example of price prediction using California housing data.

- `Gradient_Descent.ipynb` and `Gradient_Descent_For_Convex_Function.ipynb`  
  Implementations and explanations of gradient descent optimization methods.

- `Regression.ipynb` and `Simple_Regression.ipynb`  
  Additional notebooks on regression concepts.

## How to Run

- Datasets may need to be downloaded; download instructions are provided at the beginning of notebooks.  
- For online execution, Google Colab and Kaggle links are often included in the notebooks.  
- Make sure you have the required libraries installed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

## Tips

- Start with `01-Linear_Regression.ipynb` to understand basics before moving to polynomial regression and real datasets.  
- Modify code and experiment with datasets for deeper learning.
