# Chapter 01: Supervised Learning

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled datasets to perform regression or classification tasks.

## Topics Covered

- Linear Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Ensemble Learning (Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)

## Folder Structure

- `01-Linear Regression/`  
  Notebooks focusing on linear and polynomial regression implementations from scratch and using sklearn.

- `02-Logistic Regression/`  
  Notebooks on logistic regression for binary classification.

- `03-KNN/`  
  Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

- `04-Ensemble Learning/`  
  Ensemble techniques including decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost.

## Recommended Order of Study

1. Linear Regression  
2. Logistic Regression  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors  
4. Ensemble Learning

## Notes

- Some notebooks require downloading datasets; download instructions are provided within each notebook.  
- Google Colab and Kaggle links are available for online execution.
