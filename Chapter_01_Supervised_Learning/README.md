### 📝 Exercise 1: Simple Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python. The goal is to calculate the regression coefficients (slope and intercept) for a given set of data points without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn.

**The final regression equation is: $$ y = 3.35x - 2.85 $$**

#### 📊 Dataset

The model is built using the following sample data points:
* **x**: `[5, 3, -1, 2, 6]`
* **y**: `[14, 6, -5.5, 3.5, 18]`

#### ➗ Methodology

The regression line is of the form **$y = w_1x + w_0$**, where:
* $w_1$ is the slope of the line.
* $w_0$ is the y-intercept.

These coefficients are calculated using the following formulas:

1.  **Slope ($w_1$)**:
    $$ w_1 = \frac{n(\sum x_i y_i) - (\sum x_i)(\sum y_i)}{n(\sum x_i^2) - (\sum x_i)^2} $$

2.  **Y-Intercept ($w_0$)**:
    $$ w_0 = \frac{\sum y_i - w_1 \sum x_i}{n} $$

#### 🔢 Results

Based on the provided dataset, the calculated components are:
* **Number of data points (n)**: 5
* **Sum of x ($\sum x_i$)**: 15
* **Sum of y ($\sum y_i$)**: 36.0
* **Sum of xy ($\sum x_i y_i$)**: 208.5
* **Sum of x squared ($\sum x_i^2$)**: 75

Plugging these values into the formulas gives the final coefficients:
* **Slope ($w_1$)**: `3.35`
* **Y-Intercept ($w_0$)**: `-2.85`

#### ▶️ How to Run
The code is in the `Simple_Regression.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. You can open it and run the cells sequentially to see the calculations.

### 📝 Exercise 2: Analytical Linear Regression & Loss Surface Visualization

This exercise expands on simple linear regression by first simulating data with a known relationship and then finding the line of best fit analytically. It also visualizes the **Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss surface** to show how the error changes with different coefficient values.

#### 📊 Data Simulation
The data is simulated based on the linear equation **$y = -15x + 20$**, with Gaussian noise added to the `y` values to make the task more realistic. A total of 1000 data points were generated.

#### ➗ Methodology

**1. Analytical Solution**

The regression coefficients ($b_1$ for the slope and $b_0$ for the intercept) are calculated directly using the same formulas as in Exercise 1.

**2. Loss Function Visualization**

The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used as the loss function to measure the model's error. The formula is:

$$ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{pred_i} - y_i)^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}((b_1x_i + b_0) - y_i)^2 $$

A 3D surface plot is generated to show the MSE loss (on a log scale for better visualization) for a grid of different `b0` and `b1` values. The lowest point on this surface represents the optimal coefficients that minimize the error.

#### 🔢 Results

The analytical calculation produced the following regression equation:

**$$ y = -15.02x + 20.18 $$**

This is extremely close to the true relationship of $y = -15x + 20$, demonstrating that the analytical method successfully recovered the underlying pattern from the noisy data.

#### 📈 Visualization

The 3D plot of the MSE loss surface shows a clear convex bowl shape. The bottom of the bowl is the point of minimum loss, which corresponds to the analytically solved coefficients ($b_0 \approx 20$, $b_1 \approx -15$).
