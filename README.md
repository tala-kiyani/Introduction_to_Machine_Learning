# Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Introduction to Machine Learning** repository, a comprehensive collection of practical notebooks and projects designed to help you learn machine learning from basics to advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into chapters that cover different areas of machine learning:

1. **Chapter 01: Supervised Learning**  
2. **Chapter 02: Unsupervised Learning**  
3. **Chapter 03: Neural Networks**  
4. **Chapter 04: Computer Vision**  
5. **Chapter 05: Natural Language Processing**  
6. **Chapter 06: Contrastive Learning**

Each chapter contains Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and exercises related to the topics.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (in later chapters)

## Getting Started

Start by exploring Chapter 01 on Supervised Learning and gradually move through the chapters to build a solid foundation.
